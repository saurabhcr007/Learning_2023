** Question 2 **

Write a program to print the grade of the given student using if else if block <br/>
    > 90 to 100 -> "Grade A"<br/>
    > 75 to 89 -> "Grade B"<br/>
    > 60 to 74 -> "Grade C"<br/>
    > 50 to 59 -> "Grade D"<br/>
    > 0 to 49 -> "Grade F"<br/>

** Question 3 **

 Write a program to read the <br/>
    > Roll No<br/>
    > Name (Note, you should read full name of the student including initials)<br/>
    > Marks of Physics, Math and Chemistry<br/>
    Calculate the total, percentage and print the summary.<br/>

** Question 4 **

Write a simple calculator program which should accept inputs in the same order.<br/>
    > Operand 1<br/>
    > Operator<br/>
    > Operand 2<br/>
The order of scan should be same, for example, you should first scan in the following order.<br/>
printf("Enter Number1: );<br/>
Scan the first number form the user.<br/>
printf("Enter the operator: );<br/>
Scan the operator from the user.<br/>
printf("Enter Number2: );<br/>
Scan the second number form the user.<br/>

** Question 5 **

Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.<br/>
    > Set 1st bit, if operation type is 1<br/>
    > Clear 31st bit, if operation type is 2<br/>
    > Toggle 16th bit, if operation type is 3<br/>
   You can consider the below function prototype,<br/>
    > bit_operations(int num, int oper_type);<br/>
