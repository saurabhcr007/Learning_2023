** Question 5 **

Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.
    > Set 1st bit, if operation type is 1
    > Clear 31st bit, if operation type is 2
    > Toggle 16th bit, if operation type is 3
   You can consider the below function prototype,
    > bit_operations(int num, int oper_type);
