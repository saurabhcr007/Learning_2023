** Question 3 **

Write a program to sum every alternate elements of a given array starting for element 0<br/>
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be 10 + 30 + 50 = 90<br/>

** Question 4 **

Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.<br/>
Say we have a array of 3 elements<br/>
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};<br/>
The total number of set bits in the given array is<br/>
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits<br/>

** Question 5 **

Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.<br/>
Say we have a array of 3 elements<br/>
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};<br/>
The total number of set bits in the given array <br/>
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits<br/>
