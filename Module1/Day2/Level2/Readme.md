** Question 1 **

Write a program to swap every alternate element of a given array starting for element 0<br/>
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 40, 50}<br/>
one more example a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 60, 50, 40}<br/>

** Question 2 **

W.A.P to compare the items in a box, assume equal size boxes<br/>
Boxes shall have unique items stored in random order<br/>
Boxes are compared True if there is one to one mapping of items<br/>
return the final result 1 or 0<br/>

Example of Equal Boxes:<br/>
> A[3] = {200, 10, -90}<br/>
> B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}<br/>  

Example of Unequal Boxes:<br/>
> A[3] = {200, 9, -90}<br/>
> B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}<br/>

> Note: The array should not be sorted<br/>

** Question 3 **

Suppose 7 names are stored in an array of pointers names[] as shown below:<br/>
>char *name[]={<br/>
>       "Santosh", "Amol", "Santosh Jain", "Kishore", "Rahul", "Amolkumar", "Hemant"<br/>
>         }<br/>
  Write a program to arrange these names in alphabetical order.<br/>

** Question 4 **

Write a function xstrchr() which scans a string from beginning to end in search of a character. <br/>
If the character is found, it should return a pointer to the first occurrence of the given character in the string.<br/>
If the given character is not found, the function returns a NULL.<br/>
The prototype of the function should be:<br/>

> char *xstrchr(char *string, char ch):<br/>

** Question 5 **

Write a program to encode any given string such that it gets converted into an unrecognizable form. <br/>
Also write a decode function to get back the original string.<br/>
