** Question 1 **

Use structures to find the volume and the total surface area of the box. <br/>
You need to access the members of the structure with the help of a structure pointer:<br/>
>    a. With the help of (*) asterisk or indirection operator and (.) dot operator.<br/>
>    b. With the help of ( -> ) Arrow operator using pointer as well as dot representation.<br/>
